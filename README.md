# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various JavaScript and HTML features including: using console.log() to debug code, d3.select(), arrow functions, forEach() with JavaScript objects, filters with d3.select(), if-else statements, list-group-item class, label, and input tags to add filtered data to an index.html file, and script tags to an index.html file. 

### Background of Project
Dana, a journalist, has a JavaScript datafile about UFO sightings that she wants to organize and display. I built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Then, I created filters that it will react to user input, and placed the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Users will be able to search the data by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sightings.

## How to Perform a Filtered Search 
The “Filter Search” allows users to search for UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, or shape. The search can be done using any combination of filters. For example, a user could search by just the state of Oregon, just triangle shaped UFOs, or by a combination of the state of Oregon and triangle shaped UFOs.  

### FORMATING 
* Date is entered as MO/DA/YEAR
* State and Country are entered using their two letter abbreviations 

### HOW TO SEARCH 
ADD FILTER 
* Choose any filter  
* Type your criteria 
* Hit Enter [table will adjust] 
* OPTIONAL: repeat for remaining filters
